This is a recipe for one of the most famous breakfast noodle options you would find in almost every noodle shop in Jingzhou (and it is my personal favourite) - Da Lian Noodle. :yum:

[^2]: The chinese recipes are very vague on the exact amount of ingredient to prepare for dishes and that is how I was tought to make them. I deeply apologize for this.
[^3]: This practice in rather common in chinese kitchens because all the meats are bought freshly from butcher in the market.
