After reading the Five Important Considerations for Wireframing, I realized that a lot of the UX design process is also taught in my computer science class in a chapter we are taught about system design cycles. The difference, from my observation, is that besides engaging with stake holders and gathering information in the early stage and delivering lo and hi fidelity prototypes etc., the UX designer for an website targets more on the frontend and makes more choices on even details of the website like fonts or colors of bars and banners. Maybe these roles can be played by a single person in the team or, maybe in a company or studio with smaller scale, everyone has to consider user flow and content delivery as they imagine their final product.
I also think that delivering the idea clearly in the early stage is hard, and it is also sometimes hard to let your stakeholders clearly state what they envision. I guess preparing several templates or sketches of solutions could be useful?
