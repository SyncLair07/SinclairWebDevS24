DisplayRandomPhotoInArea()


I designed this function for situations where there are too many photos located near each other in a close area.
- To use this, click on the red pinpoint on the map, and click show me a photo from this area. It gives you random result each time.

(I was afriad that too many small icons on the map would not look so good.)
I currently setted the limit to more than 5 photos within a mile diameter range of selected point.
But I would have to wait until Implementing the Database to use detect this, (I hope there is a function in MapBox to locate map diameter)

Also, I realized that google map provides 200 dollars worth of service for free each month. I doubt I am going to have more than 20 thousands request each month, so I guess I will stick with that for now.
Besides MapBox, I was taught that Radar could also be useful. I am still on the process of learning the functions and benefits of each one of them.
